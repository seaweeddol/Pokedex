A functioning Pokedex!

# What did I learn from this project?
- How to make complex shapes using only CSS
- Became more familiar with positioning and styling elements
- Learned how to make API calls in Javascript

# Work to be done (priority)
- ~~Allow users to search Pokedex with a name or number~~ (11/27/2020)
- ~~Functioning number buttons to allow user input~~
- ~~Connect to [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to update Pokemon image, name, description, and type based on user input~~ (11/27/2020)
- ~~Add styling for when buttons are pressed or hovered~~
- Handle invalid input
- Implement better solution for caching (currently 'caching' with a hash)
- Add Pokedex sounds

# Work to be done (eventually)
- Make responsive for mobile devices
- Round corners and add a border to the top
- Add more shading for realism
- Make lights blink when user submits input
- Make dpad functional - left/right goes to next/previous pokemon; up/down goes to next generation/skips ahead/backwards 10 pokemon (to be determined)
