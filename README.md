# Pokedex
This will be a Pokedex web application with search functionality built with css and javascript.
https://seaweeddol.github.io/Pokedex/

# Current Version
Pokedex layout has been built out with static placeholder details. No javascript has been implemented yet.

# Work to be done (priority)
- Allow users to search Pokedex with a name or number
- Functioning number buttons to allow user input
- Connect to [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to update Pokemon image, name, description, and type based on user input
- Add styling for when buttons are pressed or hovered

# Work to be done (eventually)
- Round corners and add a border to the top
- Add more shading for realism
- Make lights blink when user submits input
- Make dpad functional - left/right goes to next/previous pokemon; up/down goes to next generation/skips ahead/backwards 10 pokemon (to be determined)
